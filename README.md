- Integration with Spring Security for authentication and authorization (optional).
- Utilizes caching for improved performance (optional).
- Declarative transaction management to ensure data integrity.
- Logging using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for method calls and exceptions (optional).

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- H2 Database (or your preferred database)
- Maven (or Gradle)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmedgamallgg/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System
   ```

2. **Build and run the application**
   - If using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - If using Gradle:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew bootRun
     ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

4. **Configure database (if necessary)**
   - By default, the application might be using an H2 in-memory database. Update `application.properties` to configure your preferred database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### API Documentation
- Provide details about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms (if implemented). You can use tools like Swagger or Springfox for generating API documentation.

### Testing
- Unit tests using JUnit and Mockito are available under the `src/test` directory. Run tests using:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
